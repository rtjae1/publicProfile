        <p>Hello, and welcome to the world of Ryan. I am very new to web development, so be kind! My name is Ryan and
            I've been
            around since 1984. I was born in Richmond, Virgina but moved quickly to Tampa, Florida. I attended Jesuit
            High School
            while in Tampa. After high school I moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia to attend Villanova University.
            I've bounced
            around the mainline ever since.
        </p>

        <p>At Villanova I majored in Psychology and Mathematics. With capstone projects on Timothy Leary and the
            Collatz Conjecture.
            Since university I have spent time on very different career paths. Right away I began in insurance, working
            on Long Term
            Disability products. After 6 years of that, I moved on and began working for a mobile canning company.
        </p>

        <p>At the top of this page, you'll find a link to my portfolio, as well as an option to contact me with any
            questions,
            comments, and feedback! Clicking on my name, or the <strong>About</strong> link, will always bring you back
            to this page right here.
        </p>
