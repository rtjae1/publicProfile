        Hello, and welcome to the world of Ryan. I am very new to web
        development, so be kind! My name is Ryan and I've been around since
        1984. I was born in Richmond, Virgina but moved quickly to Tampa,
        Florida. I attended Jesuit High School while in Tampa. After high school
        I moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia to attend Villanova University.
        I've bounced around the mainline ever since.
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        At Villanova I majored in Psychology and Mathematics. With capstone
        projects on Timothy Leary and the Collatz Conjecture. Since university I
        have spent time on very different career paths. Right away I began in
        insurance, working on Long Term Disability products. After 6 years of
        that, I moved on and began working for a mobile canning company.
